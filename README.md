# Agile Methodology

## Overview

An agile methodology was used to develop this project, using iterations on a kanban board.
GitHub projects was used to facilitate the agile development:

## Specific Implementation

+ Overaraching themes for the project were identified.
+ These were split down into epics, then User Stories to guide development from the user's perspective.
+ The project development was split into four iterations.
+ A prioritised backlog for the User Stories was utilised to ensure continuous re-evaluation of the project priorities.
+ User Stories were divided into MoSCoW groups (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have and Won't Have) and reassigned between the
groups throughout the project.
+ A kanban board was used to track each the progress of each iteration, using columns 'To Do', 'In Progress' and 'Done'.
+ During the implementation of a User Story, it was broken down into technical tasks to be completed. These were ticked off
one-by-one before the User Story was moved into the 'Done' column. These tasks are viewable by clicking on the User Stories.

# Rationale for Chosen Libraries

# UX Planning

A positive user experience was the end goal of all page design. Wireframing was done ahead of page creation for each page to guide development.
A mobile-first approach was taken for the responsive design of the website, and both mobile and desktop displays were wireframed to provide guidelines for this.

Some differences between the wireframes and final page appearances can be seen - this is because the wireframes existed to guide design and ensure a positive overall
user experience, rather than dictate specific details of the implementation.
